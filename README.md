# OWL2Predictions
DIfferent tools to calculate features used to capture the complexity of the ABox of a given ontology to improve performance prediction. 

It requires OWLAPI (versions 3.4.10 and 3.5.4 have been tested). In the IJSWIS version, TimeHarvester requires FactPlusPlus, TrOWL, and JFact libraries. 

There are currently two versions (see Tags): 
* JIST16: It corresponds to the work presented in JIST'16 paper: 
  Isa Guclu and Carlos Bobed and Jeff Z. Pan and Martin J. Kollingbaum and Yuan-Fang Li, "How Can Reasoner Performance of ABox Intensive  Ontologies Be Predicted?", Proceedings of 6th Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST 2016), Singapore (Singapore), Springer Verlag LNCS, ISSN 0302-9743, ISBN 978-3-319-50112-3, volume 10055, pp. 3-14, November 2016.
